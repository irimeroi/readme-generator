## Description
As stated in the title, this project is a README generator that creates a README file after asking a series of questions to the user.

## Installation
N/A.

## Usage
In order to create a README file, a user needs to open the index.js file in the Integrated Terminal of the code editor of their choice, and answer different questions regarding the project they are building. Once all questions has been aswered, the program automatically creates a file that can be found in the dist directory under the name 'README.md'. This file will contain all the answers the user inputted, plus a link to their email addresses and GitHub account.

## Credits
I was able to create this code thanks to the help of the TA, tutors, and old codes that were given to us as learning tools.
